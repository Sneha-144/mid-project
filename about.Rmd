### About me
I completed my undergraduate degree in B.Tech in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering (EIE) in India. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a machine learning project that sparked my curiosity helped me build my foundational skills. I also completed the Integrated Business Analytics program from IIM Indore, where I learned to use Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI and engaged in analytics-based projects that deepened my understanding of data and its applications.
After my graduation, I worked as a Senior Systems Engineer at Infosys for three years, gaining valuable industry experience. This combined exposure has fueled my passion for data analytics, and I am excited to further develop my expertise and collaborate with everyone in the program. By heart Iâ€™m a sportsperson and I like hiking and playing volleyball and table tennis.
